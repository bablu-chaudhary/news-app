# News App

A simple news application that fetches and displays news articles using the News API.

## Features
- Browse news by categories (Finance, Sports, Crypto, International, Technical, AI, Education)
- Search for news by keywords
- Click on articles to read more
- Responsive card-based layout

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Replace the API key in `server.js` with your own News API key
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Node.js (proxy server)
- News API

## Note
This app uses a Node.js proxy server because News API's free tier doesn't allow direct browser requests.
